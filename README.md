# Green Homes Now

_Fighting Climate Change One Filter at a Time_

---

## Purpose

This is my hackathon project for the Eco Hacks hackathon. The theme of the hackathon was finding novel and impactful ways to apply technology to climate change and crisises. For this I decided to address the carbon emissions caused by housing. In the US, housing makes up over one eighth of the total green house emissions produced. The main sources of emissions in housing come from electricity used for actions such as heating and cooling as well as general waste.

There are a lot of things that we can do to lessen the amount of electricity we consume and waste we produce. This is my attempt to show people areas they need to address and inform them how to do so. Big solutions come from many small actions, and I'm hoping that this app will help spur many people.
