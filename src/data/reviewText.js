// I will store the information for the questions follow up and
// the information for the other cards in this file.
// The naive expectation is that this will allow me to use a single card -> potentially not though

// This one will be difficult as I will need to match / render based on the score and state of the quiz
// My other option is just to have all of the questions shown and follow up text below
